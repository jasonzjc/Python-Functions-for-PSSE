# Python-Functions-for-PSSE
Some Pythons functions to call PSS/E for power system simulation and analysis

This respository is to gather some useful Python functions and use cases for PSS/E.
Python can be used to call PSS/E and do simulations without open PSS/E.

## History:
11/03/2017
Add the Excel export function to the use case (BasicExample.py). It can export the data from .out file into /xls file.

11/01/2017
Add the silence function (silencingPSSE.py) which turns off the PSS/E outputs or redirect it to a .log file or redirect it to a string object

10/31/2007
A simple use case (BasicExample.py) is added to show how to write up Python scripts to call PSS/E, load .sav file, calculate power flow, and do dynamic simulation.
